# Portfolio
Created online portfolio for potential employer.

Portfolio was created using HTML and CSS.

Portfolio has three sections : Getting to Know Dora, Projects & Contact Info.

Each section is in the navigation bar and will scroll down to said section when clicked on.

Images were used for homepage, bio pic and as placeholder for projects section.

Media query was added for three different screen sizes: max width 992px, 768px & 572px.

All sections of website are modified to fit all three screen sizes.

Screenshots for what the porfolio is suppose to look like in all three screen sizes will be provided in images folder.

Projects section will be updated once a project is available.
