                Dora was born in Houston, Texas. She moved to Austin, Texas in August of 2008 to attend The

                She graduated in May of 2012 with a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and a minor in Mathematics.
                Dora currently works for a tech company as one of their senior advisors in technical support. She has
                experience with troubleshooting iOS, watchOS, macOS and iPadOS, as well as the hardware of it. She has a
                passion for helping people and loves finding solutions for complex issues.
                She is currently enrolled in the UT BootCamp for Full Stack-Flex
                Development and would love to be in a role where she can utilize all her skill sets.

                When she is not working or coding, Dora loves to train her three dogs in obedience. She has a
                dachshund
                pug mix named Arsenal, a corgi mix named Artemis and a puppy sherpherd mix named Max.
                She loves
                the Star Wars universe as well as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She reads the comic books and also watches
                the movies and TV shows. Dora also loves binge watching crime shows and Korean dramas.

            <p>
                Dora admires Princess Leia from Star Wars for the reason that she continues to push foward and be a
                leader despite
                all the odds being stacked against her. Dora uses this as motivation to do the same in her personal and
                work life.
